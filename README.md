The project is still under development, the aim is to develop all pages in all their styles and responsiveness, use of routes, etc.


At the moment there is no use of CSS framework, but I see the possibility of using Styled Components, for knowledge and learning purposes, considering the knowledge of frameworks such as Tailwindcss and Bootstrap, I dispensed with their use and chose not to use them.
